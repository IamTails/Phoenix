				</br>1. If you dont have Oracle Java 1.8 JRE installed, download it from <a style="padding: 5px;" class="button button-black-stroke text-size-12" href="https://java.com/en/download/">HERE</a>
				</br>2. If you do have it installed, check the version by opening Command prompt and type java -version
				</br>3. Download the beta version of Hydra Bot from <a style="padding: 5px;" class="button button-black-stroke text-size-12" href="/download.php">HERE</a>
				</br>4. Extract it and you will find another .rar inside which is password protected.
				</br>5. The password for the zip file will be known once you've read the README file.
				</br>6. Extract the zip file and copy paste the extracted folder(Hydra-Beta-Release-0.1.3) in Downloads.
				</br>7. Open the config file and configure the values according to your needs.
				</br>8. If you're confused, refer to "How_To_Config.txt" in the extracted folder.
				</br>9. If and only if you're still confused, copy paste the "easyconfig.json" in the extracted folder and just type the lat/long, login credentials and Google API Key (How to obtain it will be explained)
				</br>10. Open Command Prompt (cmd) and type cd downloads. Press Enter and type cd Hydra-Beta-Release-0.1.3 Press Enter again.
				</br>11. Type java -jar HydraBot-0.1.3.jar
				</br>12. If you're successful, you will see "Logging in to game server"
				</br>13. Head over to hydrabot.info, type in your rest API password (normally "pass" but check the bottom of your config file)
				</br>14. Sit back, shout "Hail, Hydra!" and Enjoy the show!
				</br>
				</br>PLEASE NOTE- When exiting the bot, you MUST Press the CTRL and the C key together. 
				</br>NEVER simply hit "X" to close the windows as this does not completely close java. Once you hit CTRL+C, wait until it returns to the command line, (i.e.) you are able to type into the box again, then it is safe to "X" out of the window
