</br>*This is a beta, so it will not be perfect and you should not expect it to be. Some of the known issues are listed below.
</br>
</br>1. "Error writing export: List is empty" - Shows up in cmd as you run the bot. Its just a minor issue, don't bother. Keep the bot running.
</br>2. "Looting nearby pokestop a90f3cd1054d486ebe78254b280b5778.16" - Shows up in cmd and Web ui's console while your bot is running. If this shows up continuously, close and restart the bot.
</br>3. "Contents of the buffer are null" - If the bot is working normally catching pokemons, keep it running. If not, close and restart the bot.
</br>4. "Token not refreshed" - Close and restart the bot.
