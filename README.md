Red is a fully modular bot which comes with sets of features/commands that can be enabled/disabled to your liking, making it customizable exactly how you want.  
You can turn Red into a trivia bot, an admin bot, a music bot (...) or all of these together.  

The default set of modules includes and it's not limited to:
* admin commands
* trivia (lists included and you can make new ones!)
* music features (playlists, youtube, soundcloud, queues...)
* stream alerts (twitch/hitbox)
* slot machines (yes, really!)
* custom commands
* imgur/gif search
* and much much more

Red is in continuous development, new features get added all the time and it's supported by an active community which produces even more content (plugins!). Stay tuned by [joining the official server](https://discord.gg/0k4npTwMvTpv9wrh)!
